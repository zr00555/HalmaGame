# Halma

Create your graphical version of the two player Halma game. 

Use a 8 x 8 grid with each player having 10 tokens. 

The game must be developed using JavaFX. 

The game should implement the rules of the board gameplay (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halma). 

The game should provide instructions on the gameplay. 

The game should have an option to reset the board (restart the game). 

The game should have a button to close the application.

Optionally: Suggest and get instructor approval on a GUI game of your choice.

See included pdf for my design of the game.
